USAGE

A basic gradient descent module. Can be used to do exact line search, backtracking line search, fixed step size, or newton's method. Use sympy to create a function and list of variables. Instantiate a the GradDescent class with these as parameters. Then use the main function take_steps. Pretty straightforward.
